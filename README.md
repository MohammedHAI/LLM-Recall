# LLM-Recall

Inspired by [Windows Recall](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/retrace-your-steps-with-recall-aa03f8a0-a78b-4b3e-b0a1-2eb8ac48701c), but works with any vision-capable LLM. Only works on Windows.

Log files can be searched by text or image. Uses CLIP for image search and during screen capture, retaining only the embeddings.
